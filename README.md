# Project Timeline

- **Week 2 (September 22, 2025)**  
  By this week, we will have decided on the library(s) we will be using.

- **Week 4 (October 6, 2025)**  
  We will be recognizing the blue and red game elements pulled from a camera stream.  
  We will pull their approximate location.
  *I think we could use edge/color detection and a CNN for the field elements - need to gather dataset (could generate data)*
  *For the long goals we could just train a CNN*

- **Week 6 (October 20, 2025)**  
  We will be recognizing all the blue and red game elements in the frame, limited to what is below the top of the wall.  
  We will not be recognizing differently sized or shaped elements that are not game elements, even if they are the same color.  
  We will also be able to show the location of the game elements in relation to our robot.

- **Week 8 (November 3, 2025)**  
  We will have a rough detection of opponent robots.

- **Week 10 (November 17, 2025)**  
  We will be able to accurately detect opponent robots and track their position.  
  Everything will be integrated together.
